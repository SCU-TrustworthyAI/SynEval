    Complete Text: Last winter a blizzard woke me up in the middle of the night. My neighbor, Major Alan &#34;Dutch&#34; Schaefer was out shoveling his driveway at two a.m. He speaks with a thick Austrian accent, married a Kennedy and then had a few kids with their South American nanny. His wife eventually left him, now he lives alone across the street from me. Jesse lives across the street from Dutch. These guys are best friends, but never thought much of me. That's okay always up to some weird activity, usually involving water machine guns, stink bombs and vintage army jackets. I never joined their reindeer games. I prefer staying in my bedroom watching vintage movies from the 80s.<br /><br />On this strange night, Jesse came out of his house and looked weirdly up at the sky.<br /><br />&#34;Hey Dutch.&#34;<br />&#34;Vat?&#34; replies Dutch in his strong Germanic accent.<br />&#34;Dude...did you see that? A bright bright object entered the atmosphere. I think it crashed on the other side of that hill!&#34;<br />&#34;Don't be skerrd,&#34; responds Dutch. &#34;I call CIA for helpf.&#34;<br /><br />Jesse jumps in his car chasing the light. Dutch contacted some old army friends now working at the CIA. They found an alien unisex barbarian knit beanie monster with amazing skills: like nunchuck skills, bo hunting skills, computer hacking skills. Chicks love aliens with skills.<br /><br />Dutch jumped in front of the beanie hat screaming, &#34;come on... Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on. Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Come on! Do it now! Kill me!&#34; Before the beanie creature struck, it tripped on a log, bumped it's head and died.<br /><br />While all this was going on, I went back to sleep and didn't think about it until the next morning. Dutch and Jesse came home looking completely bedraggled, like something the cat dragged in.<br /><br />Dutch told Jesse, &#34;You betta listen to me next time when I tell you, if it bleeds ve can kill it!&#34;<br />Jesse, &#34;I know, I know, that was one... *ugly* motherf-er! Who would have thought it was a unisex barbarian green mask.&#34;<br />Dutch, &#34;I tell you, I am za best. Za CIA pushing too many pencils.Ve did zis, we killed it.&#34;<br />Jesse, &#34;All is well that ends well. Now, lets go back to my place, crack a couple beers and watch 'to catch a predator' starring Chris Hanson.&#34;<br />Dutch, &#34;Great eye-dea Jesse.&#34;

    Complete Text: I got these pajamas in the pink color. It is a pastel, peachy-pink that is quite pretty. The fabric is 95% &#34;bamboo viscose&#34; and 5% spandex. Spandex, a type of stretchy polyurethane fabric, is commonly known in the USA, but I had never heard of bamboo viscose before. Apparently it is very common in China, which is where these pajamas are manufactured.<br /><br />Bamboo viscose is a fabric known for its smooth, silky feel, which is certainly the case for these pajamas. This fabric can be made into various weights, and in the case of these pajamas, it is lightweight, but it is not flimsy. Because these pajamas are lightweight, I believe that even though they have long sleeves and long legs, they would be comfortable for most people to wear year round.<br /><br />These pajamas come with attractive edging around the neck and pant legs. Many people will prefer the wide, loose neckline. In my experience, however, such necklines are inevitably going to stretch out, so the bigger the neckline is initially, the sooner the pajamas (or T-shirt with a boat neckline) become so stretched out that they are unwearable.<br /><br />Because these pajamas are made of stretchy fabric, they will accommodate a wide range of people in the various sizes. I personally believe it fits true to size.<br /><br />There are no care instructions on these pajamas in English, so I looked up care instructions for bamboo viscose online:<br /><br />1. Do not submerge in water more than a total of 40-50 minutes, which includes both washing and rinsing.<br />2. Wash by hand or on the most delicate cycle your washer offers, ideally placed in a lingerie bag for further protection.<br />3. Wash in cold water.<br />4. Do not put in the dryer, instead, hang up to dry.<br />5. Do not use bleach.<br />6. Do not dry clean.<br />7. Iron on medium heat.<br /><br />Be aware that since these pajamas are made in and shipped from China, it will take weeks for them to arrive, so plan accordingly.<br /><br />Attached are some pictures of the pajamas.<br /><br />All in all, I rate these pajamas as follows:<br />Attractiveness: 5 stars<br />Comfort: 5 stars<br />Ease of care: 3 stars<br />Lack of care instructions: 1 star<br />Overall: 3.5 stars, rounded to 4 stars<br /><br />I did a bit of research on bamboo viscose, and I have included below some of what I learned for the benefit of customers who might be as curious about this type of fabric as I was:<br /><br />Bamboo viscose is considered to have a strong ecological advantage over rayon, which is manufactured from cellulose obtained from wood pulp. Unlike the trees from which wood pulp is obtained, bamboo does not take years to grow to a usable height. In fact, bamboo reaches its full height in a matter of only 8-10 weeks. Because bamboo is a grass, unlike a tree, it regenerates after being cut down just like the grass on a lawn grows back each time it is mowed. In addition, harvesting bamboo is actually good for the health of the plant, causing more vigorous regrowth. The bamboo species most commonly used in China to create cloth, and from there made into clothing, is Moso bamboo. Over 2% of the total forested area in China, three million hectares (a hectare is 2.471 acres or 10,000 square meters), is employed to grow commercial bamboo.<br /><br />Bamboo can grow almost anywhere, except a really cold climate, and it especially prospers in tropical climates. There have been attempts to encourage wide-scale production of bamboo in the USA, but so far it hasn't caught on to a large extent--no doubt because in the global marketplace it can be cheaply imported from Asia.<br /><br />The most likely places for large-scale bamboo farming to occur in the USA are Hawaii and Southeastern states such as Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee.

The tiny metal buttons you had to push in yourself, and also scratched the case on my watch. This is very disappointing and must be due to bad craftsmanship to not be consistent on both connectors. Now my brand new expensive watch I’ll never resell for when it should and this watch and never even had a different band on it it was new out-of-the-box only having the rubber band on it once. I did report this to Juuk.<br /><br />Juuk Response<br />Juuk has not responded or offered to replace the band or anything actually. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a cheaper band that opened up in better quality and most likely the company will respond and make things right.

    Complete Text: At 4.99 for the pair and $4.99 for shipping and handling, the hats average out to under five bucks each.<br /><br />I bought several inexpensive beanie hats from different vendors through Amazon and the four that I've received so far from the Florida Hat Company and Hair Coverings are all very good.  They have a nice tight weave, so they are not slouchy beanies; they're beanies that look presentable.  They are all nice, bright colors.  Without any stretching, they each have a circumference of approximately 14 inches, which you can of course stretch to fit a normal size head.<br /><br />I'm a small female who lives in New York and similar type hats have been my hat of choice for years.  Each of the hats that I describe below have a good weave that is adequate enough to keep me warm in temperatures below fifty degrees; I don't find them suffocating hot in moderate temperatures and they keep me comfortable in thirty degree weather.  I'm not foolish enough to stay out too long in temperatures lower than that; my lower earlobes may get a bit cold, but it's not bad.<br /><br />From Hair Coverings, I bought two hats that were labeled royal blue, but in truth one is closer to teal in color and is more inexpensive.  The royal blue is the best of the four hats in terms of the quality of the acrylic yarn and the weave.  It has no pills.  The length is 12 ¾ inches.  The teal hat is also good, but the quality of the yarn isn't as flawless as the royal blue; it's a little pilly, since the thread looks a bit uneven.  It's still a good hat, however.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />From the Florida Hat Co., I received the described hunter's orange hats that come as a pair.  These have a slightly looser weave, but it's so minor that it's barely noticeable.  The yarn is good, no pills.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />If anyone reading this is from the Highridge area of Yonkers and is familiar with the 99 cent store near Pathmark that sold similar beanies, you'll have a better reference as to the quality of these hats.  Each of the hats I bought on-line are within the four to five dollar range; I purposely chose those low prices because I was looking for a hat that's similar to the hats I used to purchase in Yonkers, which had a nice weave, weren't too hot, and have held up well in the wash for years.  Well, the on-line hats meet all those qualities and are a bit larger with a slightly tighter weave.  For me, they're excellent, and I'm glad that I was able to find pretty, bright colors that offer some degree of visibility when I'm crossing the street.

    Complete Text: I love kickboxing--in fact, it's one of the few forms of cardio that I truly enjoy.  Unfortunately, I found this DVD to be disappointing.  The moves themselves were fun and the combinations were mostly interesting, but I did not click at all with the teaching style of the instructor, Ilaria Montagnani.  In this workout, Ilaria teaches very LONG combinations of punches and kicks.  Although she teaches in an &quot;add-on&quot; style, starting with a few moves and then adding on new moves, each time she goes back to the beginning, she does NOT cue the moves!  For example, she will simply say &quot;let's start again,&quot; and then the reviewer is expected to recall all the moves up to that point WITHOUT Ilaria saying what they are.  This is made even more difficult by the camera angles--e.g., sometimes the camera is focusing on Ilaria from the waist up only, so you can't see the kicks that she is doing.<br /><br />If each combination was short and repeated many times, this might not be such an issue, but as noted above, the combos are quite lengthy.  I have described each below.  To make matters worse, the combinations are DIFFERENT on each side of the body--in her Introduction, Ilaria says that this does not matter, as you will be doing about the same number of punches and kicks, but it definitely felt uneven to me.  All times listed are approximately.<br /><br />WARM-UP (5 minutes)<br />Mostly alternating punches front, including jab, cross punch, hook, and upper cut.  The front push kick is included as well, but no other kicks are practiced in the warm-up.  I set of push-ups is performed at the end.<br /><br />PUNCHES (7 minutes)<br />Here Ilaria introduces a long punch combination.  The combination is performed for many sets (12-16?) on one side, then repeated on the second side.  These are the punches (slashes denote where each piece is added on):<br />jab-jab-cross / hook-cross / upper-cross / fast 3 right-fast 3 left / jab-cross<br /><br />KICKS (10.5 minutes)<br />This was more drills than combinations and was easier to follow.  Ilaria begins with a front chamber/front kick.  Next is a side chamber/roundhouse, building up to three roundhouse kicks.  The third kick was the crescent, starting with alternating knees to the side and then adding in the crescent.  Finally, the side kick was performed with a chamber/side kick, then moving on to a double knee/side kick/squat.<br /><br />COMBINATION #1, LEFT SIDE (6.5 minutes)<br />knee-double front push kick / opposite knee crescent / walk around, opposite knee roundhouse / squat-roundhouse-knee / double roundhouse / jab-cross hook-cross upper-cross<br /><br />COMBINATION #2, RIGHT SIDE (6 minutes)<br />jab-jab-cross / front push kick, 2x / opposite leg crescent / walk around, opposite leg roundhouse / squat, roundhouse x3<br /><br />COMBINATION #3, face forward (10 minutes)<br />hi level block to side / mid level block to side / alternating sides with side kicks / karate punches<br /><br />STRETCH (3 minutes)<br />This is a very brief segment that includes a low back release, a lunge for the hip flexors, a standing side stretch/backbend, and a standing triceps stretch.  It did not feel adequate given the overall length of the workout (over 50 minutes).<br /><br />I actually liked the moves in Combo #3 the most, but I also found this combination to be the MOST frustrating!  Ilaria's cuing seemed almost totally random here, as I could never figure out which side she was going to next; I don't think she worked the sides evenly at all.  It didn't help that the music sometimes would drown her out (and on top of that, I found her accent sometimes difficult to understand as well).  I will say that Ilaria DID give excellent form pointers throughout the workout.  Personally, however, I wish she would have spent more time actually cuing the moves themselves.

    Complete Text: I recently returned from a 4-week cruise to Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Marquesas.  I explored Honolulu and Hilo for a souvenir shirt and didn't find anything of the quality and price I wanted (seriously, WAY overpriced at the shops).  I waited until I returned home and explored my options on Amazon.  Saw this shirt and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Very happy I did -- the quality of the material and construction is much better than one would expect for this price point.  Even the pocket has been carefully cut and aligned so that it blends seamlessly into the fabric pattern (see photo).<br /><br />I'm a plus-size woman who usually wears a size 2X from Woman Within or 3X from Travelsmith or NorthStyle.  I ordered size 4X in this shirt and it fits as expected -- a little large, but I prefer a looser fit.  I could probably have done just fine in a 3X without feeling like it was too small.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with my purchase.  Washes nicely, comfortable to wear, fit and fabric/construction quality better than expected.  Solid 5 stars.

    Complete Text: I ordered this mask because New York is my hometown and I'm proud of being from there. This mask was made in Korea, not China, which is also a plus in my book as Korea also managed to control the virus unlike the US. It's flexible and very close fitting to your face - this is great as you don't want any gaps where the virus could get in. It includes a filter that you can tape to the inside of the mask. Usually these rubbery-type of masks don't include filters, so I was surprised by this inclusion. It works well though it's a little hard to breathe through this thing for long periods. Fortunately it's good enough to wear for daily errands. Overall I'm satisfied with this mask though if you are traveling to other areas (like Trump-favoring areas) it may mark you out as a New Yorker.

    Complete Text: I ordered 2 different kinds of purses from Miss Lulu on October 4th with NO RUSH delivery (because I didn't need these until next week). I saw that there was only 1 more purse in stock in Black/Black. I was pretty sure that I got it & would be no problem getting both at the same time. Instead, 2-3 days later my order for the Black on Black purse was cancelled, "due to a lack of availablity". But when I was given a list of other options on what to repurchase, I saw that the exact same item was still AVAILABLE, but in a much higher amount, than originally listed on my original order.<br /><br />I contacted the seller, Miss Lulu. The seller could have had me return the Black/White purse and sent me the Black/Black. But the seller was no real help and didn't seem to care about me, as the customer and my dissatisfaction on what happened. They only replied with 2 sentences. I only wanted the Black on Black purse. Sellers usually will think of a resolution for the customer. But this did not happen.<br /><br />I needed it this purse specifically for a job interview this week so they are very dishonest & even had my original review deleted. And I would have been a loyal customer, since I love the size & quality of my casual brown tote purse.<br /><br />I personally cannot respect sellers that operate like this. Especially when all they think about is profit and not the customer's needs or feelings like in my particular case.<br /><br />As for the purses themselves, in their pictures when ordering, it looks small so you think that you're getting at least maybe a small/medium-sized purse that could fit some simple stuff in it. That is what I was going for. But these purses do run fairly big/huge. If you are looking for a slightly smaller purse, then this is simply NOT the purse for you. Furthermore, I feel the material (since I have long nails) can be easily scratched/damaged and I feel that the white part of the purse can be easily dirted. If it would have been Black on Black, these fears would be diminished.<br /><br />Again, if the seller would have properly taken care of my original order as I reached out to them about it, they would have had 5 stars from me.  I sincerely hope that they will learn from this experience to keep more inventory & respect customers a lot more.

    Complete Text: Family PJs are not really my thing but our kids love Hanna Andersson PJs and this is a great whimsical christmas print.  Even though I'm not really into the whole family PJ thing, I have to give the Hanna Andersson designers credit because they are very skilled at coming up with great patterns that are gender-neutral and appealing to both kids and adults.. not an easy thing to do.<br /><br />Hanna Andersson clothes are euro sized and fit slightly slimmer than typical American sizing, similar to how H&M tends to fit a bit slimmer than GAP . While their clothes are not cheap, they are well made and hold up well to repeated washings which is important for kids clothing that tends to see a lot of abuse and spills.<br /><br />The prices on their kids PJs are high but reasonable I think, the adult sizes on the other hand are way over priced.. but I guess they know there are enough instagram obsessed adults out there willing to splurge hundreds of dollars on matching PJs for a cute family photo.

The bands fit the watch perfectly and are so much more comfortable than the mesh band that came with the watch.<br /><br />I have the 3 pack of Midnight Blue/Lavender/Pine Needle Green. The Midnight Blue is navy-ish, the Lavender is very light purple, and the Pine Needle Green is a teal/green shade.<br /><br />I have size small, which fits wrists 5.5 to 7.3 inches. My wrist is at the beginning of the size range, closer to 5.5 inches, and so the bands are almost too big for me. I fasten them on the very first hole. The bands do fit, just something to be aware of if you have small wrists.<br /><br />The watch bands are secure, both holding the smartwatch and on the wrist. I tried to tug them off the watch, to see how well they held and was unable to do so. On my wrist, the band didn’t come undone; it’s comfortable to wear all day long.

I thought I would surprise her with a little something for the first week of Advent and she went nuts when this arrived!<br />I bought this in red, and it is a really nice, bright red.<br /> It fit her perfectly, so it is true to size as long as you MEASURE and use the size chart from the company! Asian sizes tend to befuddle people but I have been ordering from Chinese companies for some time now and as a habit, I even check the size charts for US companies now.<br />It's a silky, really soft but not too thin material but not as hot or thick as a traditional sweatshirt.<br />You can safely gift this to any teenager who watch shows on MTV ... they will get it The Stilinski reference) and love it.

    Complete Text: I love this shirt! It's the perfect style for Autumn in South Texas. Long sleeves, super soft cotton, and we can wear it everywhere.<br />With daughters who raid each other's closets as well as mine, this shirt is being passed around and shared. I bought it in black, and so far, it hasn't shrunk, it is easy to care for, and has not faded, either.<br />The lace &#34;pocket&#34; accent is adorable and you can wear this with blue, black or white jeans and it will look terrific. My girls have worn it with shorts as well.<br />It's a great &#34;go to&#34; shirt on the weekend. Personally, I value comfort but don't really want to look like a slob when running errands and the like, so I can wear this. Worth every penny.<br />I buy a lot of things from China so I have to advise anyone reading this to measure, measure measure! That way you'll have a great fit and be happy Asian sizing is very different from US sizing - so don't get discouraged if you wear a 2X in Asian sizes and an 8 or 10 US size!).<br />I will be on the lookout for more deals from this company.

I have several white Murano beads, and this is my favorite. The &#34;but&#34; and lower rating is because the first one arrived damaged.  It had scratches on the surface.

So, I ordered another from a U.S. company, the U.S. company's mask was a little disappointing.  They stretched out the image resulting in a slightly, but obviously blurry image, and also resulted in the white material looking dirty, not a bright white color.<br /><br />This mask from China arrived today, sooner than I expected.  It is just beautiful.  The mask material feels silk-like.  The image I sent them is clear and crisp, the material is a bright white.  Not only did it cost less than the US-made mask, but it also came with filters.<br /><br />I am really happy with this mask and I know my mother will love it.

I wore it everywhere. And was especially happy to have it on a trip through the fjords in Norway!<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to give it away due to a washing/shrinkage incident. I am looking to replace it and to my deep chagrin, it appears that this style is no longer available.<br /><br />I received one of the best compliments on it when I was on a bus from London to Oxford and an Irish gentleman commented that I was wearing a very fine jumper. Turns out his family had been participated in knitwear industry and he recognized the quality.<br /><br />Please consider bringing it back.

    Complete Text: After buying Sleep Phones for several years (6 pairs of them, I believe) and having each pair break internally by the plug, I decided it was time to try something less expensive.  That way, even if the cord breaks, I won't have spent as much money.  So far, that's working out fine.  Here's my comparison of Afunta Sleep Headphones with the Sleep Phones.<br /><br />I have had the Afunta Sleep Headphones now for a while, and here's what I've noticed.  The speakers are hard, thicker than the Sleep Phones speakers and aren't flexible.  On the other hand, they're comfortable if you lie on your back, and I find them perfectly comfortable when the side of my head is on my pillow unless I'm using a harder pillow, which I don't recommend you do.  These headphones are quieter than the Sleep Phones, which are quieter than my regular headphones, but are loud enough to listen to audiobooks or music to fall asleep to.  They're usually loud enough to wear doing chores, although they may not be loud enough to do dishes with.<br /><br />I haven't had the Afuntas long enough for the speaker wires to break, but I never heard back from Sleep Phones when I emailed them about the broken ones, and besides - they don't pay shipping for replacement parts, and after owning so many pairs that broke in the same spot, this would add up to the cost of at least another pair of Sleep Phones.<br /><br />One odd things others have mentioned about the Afuntas is that the speakers are loose in the headband.  I adjusted to that pretty quickly, but if you throw your headphones down on the night table like I do, expect the speakers to be located in a different place in the band than they were when you removed them.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is this: the Afunta Sleep Headphones are comfortable for me, I can listen to my audio books and do chores and workouts while wearing them and they cost about half of what the Acoustic Sheep Sleep Phones cost.  If I slept with one of my ears on a firm pillow, these might not be the best for me - the Sleep Phones would be - but since I sleep on soft pillows, I'm happy with my Afuntas and their lower price.

Which is why no pic, it made it’s way up in the Sacred Closet Shelf as soon as he opened it. Carefully put in the front of a row of his collected hats, the really nice ones he only occasionally wears. He will pick out the one he wants to wear when we go “out” - to dinner, visit friends etc. Yes we have adapted to our country home of 25 years, on 9 acres in the the sticks,  5 acres of which is a pond. We have converted to Midwest hicks who have “dress” brimmed baseball  hats lol. It has pride of place among the Coast Guard, NYFD, FBI, and many more.<br /><br />To the hat’s quality, I can say it is well made, thick material and well sewn and put together. The embroidered insignia is well sewn and tightly and neatly applied. It is a high quality lid indeed. If you have a hat lover or collector, this would be a really great gift. I guarantee they will like it

I guess it depends on who is sewing them..Are they 10 years old, or what?<br /><br />The top part has No seams, its made from one piece of material,including the  sleeves , very strange.<br /> The bottom part is a separate piece of material that is sewed  on.<br /><br />I’m returning this.<br />Btw, it took a month to finally receive this!!

I'm guessing that you would receive the right name if you ordered it from Amazon directly.  So I will review it for what the product is.  It is an inexpensive script metal name.  It has a plating of gold and looks OK, although I think it would be appreciated most by girls younger than 12.  I think it looks fairly elegant, but perhaps a bit of a cheesy idea in general.  The chain is ok and it looks ok when worn. I've switched between 3 and 4 stars and it is probably 3.5 in that we mildly like it.

The material is somewhat soft and silky. The size is far, far more than 'a little small.' I seriously suggest if you wear an American medium the XL or maybe the Large from Toponechoice would possibly be a fit for you. It's very hard to judge the proper size to order because they run so small. They do come in a rather beautiful gift-box.<br />I received this item in exchange for my review.

I'm not sure that you'd want to carry your passport (it would get bent due to curve of your leg), but it worked well for carrying cash and credit cards (it has two generous sized zipped pockets). It remained well concealed under his jeans, without creating a visible bump. It was one of several items that we used for this trip, the others being: a Wrist Wallet (I wore this on my ankle), zippered socks, security zippered belt and a bra wallet.  We felt less vulnerable since we were able to spread our cash and credit cards to different parts of our body.

One look at these shorts when they arrived and I knew they wouldn't fit me. It was then I went to the home page of this product only to find out that 5x in Asian sizes is actually XL in U.S. sizes. So on that score alone, this product is unusable for me.<br /><br />There's more though. Take a closer look at the photos of these shorts on the product page. The zippered pockets are presumably meant to have a racing stripe, a sporty effect. On the actual shorts though, the zippers look tacky and cheap, as though one hard tug would rip them right off. The little white circles around the drawstrings look like cheap, paste on decals. The metal tips on the end of the drawstrings also look shoddy and seem like they will fall off fairly quickly. Even if these shorts had fit me, I would not have been happy with them and would have expected them to fall apart fairly quickly. Two stars is actually being generous to this shabby product.

The opening tallness is good-even for my wife/tall footed kid whom I have issues getting anything but full Velcro or full tie shoes on.  The squeak seemed weird from the day I got these-but they were purchased a size big intended for summer, bought at Christmas. Anyway the squeaker fell out of a shoe (never happened in the years my daughter wore wee squeak-and I couldn’t find the extra squeakers they sent with.  I got out my daughters shoes and took a squeaker out of her shoe and put into these-the sole is coming loose and the air is escaping rendering the squeak useless.<br /><br />EDIT 6/11/18  I contacted Wee Squeak and they told me this was not their product.

I don’t know if Genuine Assembly offers a 33”, but fortunately a belt is enough to keep the jeans up. I’d say these aren’t that skinny of a fit. At the same time, the jeans aren’t stretchy. At all.<br /><br />The tag says made in Bangladesh, from 98% cotton and 2% spandex.<br /><br />I don’t love the denim. It’s not that soft and has a smell even after washing.

I regret getting it, and I can’t quite imagine myself wearing what feels more like a Halloween costume than clothing. It photographs well, so my pictures, as well as the product pictures, look fine. But in person, the vinyl is just gross in my opinion. It also has a detail at the center front bottom that is meant to give the impression of having two layers, but because of how it’s constructed, it just looks cheap, and there’s even a bit of puckering. The last item is also problematic: news reports have been coming out of cotton sourced from China (particularly the Xinjiang region) being harvested from forced labor. It doesn’t have information on where the cotton is from, so the whole thing makes me uneasy and regretful of having gotten this. Can’t recommend it for a number of reasons.

    Complete Text: Oh, boy, have I ever got to get myself some more of these. I am 4'11&#34; and sixtysomething. A little over a year ago, I weighed 208 lbs. and am now 82 lbs. lighter. Figuring out what size to wear in clothes and getting things that look good on me even as I keep shrinking has been a real challenge. When I was offered a pair of these leggings at a discount in return for my honest review, I decided to get a small (which comes closest to my hip measurement) instead of a medium (to fit my waist) because I know I'll be losing a little more weight. I am SO glad I got the smaller size! I don't think I would have liked the medium size at all. I thought when I first pulled them out of the wrapper that I'd made a big mistake, because they looked positively tiny and I thought I'd never be able to get into them. But they stretched right out to fit me like a glove but also cover really well.<br /><br />Other leggings I've had have been either too baggy on me or too tight in some places and too loose in others. These fit incredibly well all over, even at my waist. They are very smooth and don't pill at all, and they don't pick up as much lint as the others do. In fact, with the exception of the model's gorgeous flat belly, these leggings look EXACTLY on me like the do on the model. The length is the same (I've got short little legs) and my lower body even looks like that. (Do you know how good that feels after being a SIZE 18?) And they make me look toned and fit, even though the skin on my thighs is pretty saggy after losing so much.<br /><br />I do fitness walking and indoor cycling. These leggings are very comfortable for both activities. They are warm, but warm like my skin might be warm; they feel like they are a part of me. I've tested some compression products designed to keep your knees warm and massaged while walking to avoid injury, and I really don't see why these would not do the same job if you get a snug enough fit as I did.<br /><br />I'm really thinking these are at least partially made out of bamboo (a cotton/bamboo blend, probably), because they are very similar in feel—wonderful—to a few bamboo tops I have.They wash up the same, too. I hand-wash all of my clothes except bedding because we don't have easy access to a washing machine where I live. I have some Yummy Tummy leggings I got last year on eBay that are a whole heck of a lot easier to wash by hand than denim jeans are, but these Hoveox leggings are even easier and drip dry really quickly.<br /><br />Speaking of bamboo, I read on Wikipedia, I think it was, that in the U.S. bamboo items must be labeled as polyester, but polyester sounds so fake and man-made, unlike bamboo, which is a renewable resource and biodegradable to boot. I hope I'm right that these are made of bamboo. I hope the vendor will include more specifics on the product on the product page, including inches for measurements to help American buyers. And I don't think I'd make the same recommendation some others here have to buy up a size. These leggings have ample stretch, so I'd say go with the size that most of your measurements fit the best and don't worry too much if one area is a bit larger than what is stated. I'm really glad I fit to my hips.

My wrist is a little on the large size and I use the large band that came with my Versa. This one fits, but only when it's adjusted to the last hole. And at that hole, it's a snug fit.

This type of top needs a class of its own- Because, ones definition is different when using the word “sweatshirt!“ This has a smooth, thin, sheen to the fabric that is present with some of the cheaper made items.. this doesn’t look bad when seen from a photo- but, as the person wearing it.. I didn’t care for it at all. most likely because, I was expecting something for a different in the traditional sense of the word sweatshirt!! I feel, it takes more than cuffed neck, sleeve, waist to be classified as such.. So, for this reason- I was a bit let down.<br /><br />My next issue would be the fact, this material does not breathe in any real capacity.. it has that synthetic blend which causes sweat and also, static electricity..!! (Tbh, it reminds me of nightgowns back when I was a little girl.. and not in a good way! Fun to wear- but, just as obnoxious!!)<br /><br />The final piece that didn’t feel right and I will own this for not investigating deep enough. Marbled is not dyed material!! It is imprinted onto the outside layer- this is the type when inside out.. it looks white!<br /><br />As for the fit and construction, this seems to be on point with US sizing and made to expected standards for the price. No loose threads or, poor craftsmanship + stitching. This is just taking a cheaper quality blend material and designing into a “sweatshirt” style cut. If, a synthetic thin top is what your looking for- This may be for you.. but, unfortunately- not for me. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!<br />*For reference: I’m 5’2”, 154lb, 38C, 40+ yr. old with trouble spot thru the middle (thx x4 kids and gravity..)

    Complete Text: I typically do not wear watches, though when I do it has typically been the less expensive kind that you can find in a department store. My usual limit for spending on a watch has usually been about $35. Burei watches are a lot nicer than what I usually wear but they are not astronomically priced. I have seen several Burei watches and this one has emerged as my favorite so far. It fits me beautifully and it looks very elegant and sophisticated.<br /><br />This watch has gone with a simplistic approach in design – not too cluttered and concentrate on doing things right. I have had this watch for a week and it has kept perfect time so far, though to be fair it takes months before you can tell if a watch is keeping or losing time. The face has the three basic hands: hours, minutes and seconds. It also has a small dial that tells the hour in 24-hour format. At first I thought this was strictly decorative, but it actually does work and the small hand on it moves through the day.<br /><br />The face has a cut-out where you can see a small portion of the inner workings. For a better look, take a peek at the back of the watch, though the inner gears are not all that visible regardless.<br /><br />This is a self-winding watch and through the window on the back you can see the weight that winds the watch as you move. So, while there is no battery to replace, it does mean that if you do not wear the watch for a while it will eventually stop.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with the majority of watches I have tried is that they usually do not fit me very well at all. They are either too tight even on the largest setting or I can’t get them to fit at all. This watch has a very generous metal band that fits me nearly perfectly. When closed, and without removing any of the links, the band has enough play in it to allow the watch to move a little bit but not so much that it turns from the top of my wrist. I have huge hands and large wrists so this is not going to work for a lot of people but in the package is a tool for removing links so you can adjust the band to fit properly.<br /><br />Finally, this is an absolutely beautiful watch. I have received many, many compliments from people when they see it and they ask me about it.<br /><br />This is a wonderful luxury watch, more upscale than what you will find in a department store and nowhere near as expensive as some of the more expensive brands like Rado or Tag. There are two important considerations when buying a more expensive watch: does it fit and does it keep time. For me, this watch does both and I am very satisfied with it. The fact that it is very attractive is a bonus.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.

I wore the drop earrings (not sure what to call each pair, so I'll refer to them as 'drop' and 'spiral') to church on Christmas Eve and received quite a few compliments on them.  I wore the spiral on Christmas Day and had numerous family members compliment them as well!  They are, as promised, lightweight. In fact, one of my earring holes ripped/stretched years ago when a baby grabbed at an earring. Because of the stretched hole, I cannot wear heavy earrings.  Both of these were fine to wear.  You CAN bend the earrings to adjust to your comfort/appearance as to how you want them to hang.  (be gentle..but they ARE made to be bent!) Both come with clear backings that are pretty much impossible for anyone to see.  I have sensitive skin and there are some earrings that cause the backs of my ears to become cracked and peel...I did NOT have any issues with these earrings!  Care instructions for the earrings are on the Amazon page and I HIGHLY recommend reading them!  (Nothing hard/complicated, just tells you how to store/clean them) Its obvious these earrings are handmade. I love that the description on the Amazon page says, " This Earrings Are Handcrafted And May Have Slight Irregularities Which Is A Natural Outcome Of Human Involvement In The Process And Often These Imperfections Adds To The Handmade Appeal Of These Beautiful & Unique Pieces. "  Just goes to show the care and work that are put into making these gorgeous earrings by the gifted artists who craft them! They're gorgeous and so very detailed.  Its clear the artist who made them loved doing so.  So much time and energy put into making such lovely jewelry!  Both pair come in small, plastic bags inside a plastic storage container, along with a small fabric pouch to keep the earrings in.  (Again, I recommend reading the care instructions for storage and cleaning info)<br /><br />I love them.  I was so sure the spiral pair was my favorite but then I put the drop pair on and changed my mind! lol. When I wore the spiral the next day, I was back to thinking that pair was my favorite! lol.  They're both just gorgeous.  I love them.  They look wonderful if you're dressed up but also look just as wonderful when wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  I cannot recommend these earrings enough.  Absolutely stunning!  I think its going to be quite some time before I wear any other earrings in my collection!<br />photo#1 is the 'drop' earring, photos #2 the 'spiral', photo#3 is both pairs, plastic storage case and pouch

    Complete Text: My husband works at home, so aside from having to attend a funeral, wedding or special work event,  he only wears a tie occasionally.  For months now, he's only had one tie to cover all of those events and not long ago, his one and only tie was demolished in the washing machine by the agitator. lol.<br /><br />Recently, he had to appear in court to testify in a trial involving a family member.  We had plenty of advance notice of the trial so when the 2 pack of the Awesome 360 Men's classic tie appeared in my Vine account, the timing was perfect!<br /><br />One of the two ties pictured in the photo above (directly from Awesome 360's Amazon page) was in the box-the pink and silver striped tie.  The solid blue tie in the same photo was not included in his 2 pack. Instead, he received a VERY nice blue/violet checkered tie. Both ties are VERY nice and both match a variety of shirts that he already owns.  On the first day of court, he wore the blue/violet checkered tie and it looked wonderful!  He wasn't happy when he learned he'd have to return for a second day and quite honestly, he was not looking forward to wearing the pink and silver tie. (He refers to it as 'pink', I think its more of a  'magenta' shade)  The silver stripes on this tie shimmer a bit.  At first he said he thought he looked like the "Gooe Humour ice cream man" (don't ask...I have NO clue where he got that from! lol) but he actually got some compliments on the tie and he ended up  liking it!  And it looked VERY nice!<br /><br />Both ties are nice and go so well with a variety of colored shirts.  Both wore well and were easy to tie without issue.  These ties are very nice and a good value for the price.  (After losing his other tie to the washing machine agitator, I hand washed both of these and they did very well!)

    Complete Text: At this moment I am wearing a pair of these pants I purchased at a big box store in Navy color at least 2 years ago or like $12 bucks.  Same pockets, same style --- exactly.  Not 1 lint ball, not 1 tear.  The only place where there's obvious wear is at the bottom, rear heels area.  (And for that area, I always spray with some Shout before I throw them in the washer).  In the years I have had these pants I have probably washed them 100 times.  THEY ARE AWESOME.  So awesome in fact, that they are my ever go to.  I wear them outside in the yard.  I wear them for quick trips to the shopping.  They still look great and hold their shape!  I thought, "They're getting old and you wear them so much you better purchase another pair now."<br />Now to this new purchase.  First, it is next to impossible to find them online and in the stores.  I know because I have been trying.  Second, I paid twice the amount of money for this new pair (which is NOT ALL THE reason I am giving this product a 1 star.  In fact, if they were of the same quality as my first pair I'd gladly - as demonstrated - paid twice as much with zero complaint and a 5 star rating).  BUT THESE PANTS ARE CHEAPLY MADE!!!!<br />The material is so cheap and poorly made... so awful.  I've washed them twice and they already have those unsightly lint balls!  I don't get it.  They look exactly the same but for the color (because NAVY was sold out everywhere).  My level of disappointment in Eddie Bauer is beyond description.  It is at a level that the brand name means poor quality to me such that I will never buy anything bearing it's name.  When you have such a respected brand name, smart manufacturers guard their quality at a nervous, OCD level.  Not Eddie Bauer.  If you've been looking for a second pair of these pants, just be grateful you have 1 already and go to another brand.

He's a mens 7.5 and these are really almost too short/small. I've stretched a tiny 'run' into one on the first attempt at putting his socks on him. I'd definitely say these are sized more for womens feet, specifically the typically smaller womens sized feet found in the country of manufacture (the average womens shoe size in the US is either an 8.5 or 9 and in Asian countries I believe i read it's more like a U.S. 5 or 5.5.).<br /><br />Can't comment on the compression value unless they calculate compression value with algebra, spandex percentage and the foot size the socks are manufactured for 🤷🏼‍♀️

    Complete Text: I own a number of Booq products, so when I was offered a review sample of this new model I accepted. Like all Booq bags the emphasis is on efficient management of space as well as protecting electronics. This bag is no exception.<br /><br />First, unlike the other bags that I own this one is kind of complicated, In fact, the shoulder strap and stabilizer strap design drove me crazy at first. Even the instruction card was of little help. Basically I had problems grasping how the magnetic buckle and stabilizing straps were designed for, as well as the fact that the shoulder pad on the strap hid the magnetic buckle when I first unboxed it. I finally figured it out with patience and carefully studying the diagrams.<br /><br />Second, at first I thought the shoulder and stabilizer straps were poorly designed. I was wrong. They are designed for perfect ergonomics and balance. Again, this is a learning curve issue. In some ways Booq has been too clever in the design because there is a complexity that takes time to learn. For me it's worth it because I can carry a relatively heavy load (about thirty pounds) in a balanced fashion and still be assured that the tablet and a few other electronic odds and ends I carry are well protected. Protection is one area where Booq excels.<br /><br />This is not trendy fine leather. Vegans will love it, and while I do not know exactly what it is, it's some sort of durable plastic material that is superbly constructed. The stitching, webbing, clasps and zippers are all first rate. Water literally rolls off it, and the reflective piping is a nice touch with respect to safety, whether walking or cycling.<br /><br />Organizational options and features are another Booq hallmark. Instead of my trying to describe them in detail, look at the product photos on this page. There is a place for everything, and it has been well thought out. I've had this bag for a week and am still discovering compartments.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a bag that does take time to learn. It probably should come with a video or a link to one, which will make it immediately useful because I can assure you that the first day of ownership will be frustrating. Take your time and learn it because after that you will love it totally.

    Complete Text: Wearing size 11W women's shoes, I often have trouble finding things to fit, especially more casual footwear like slippers.  This is my first pair of Dearfoams, and I'm happy to say that the XL size fits my large-ish feet beautifully!  I purchased them to take along on my trek to visit family for the holidays for two weeks where "casual" at-home wear was key.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that these performed beautifully.  No tight spots anywhere, but they're not overly large, either.  They stay on going up and down stairs, too -- that, to me, is the real test of "fit."  They got a good workout, with daily wear (evening and morning for a couple of hours each) and stuffing into my suitcase.  I'm planning to take them along on my next adventure: a cruise to Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Marquesas.<br /><br />Very happy with these.  Would purchase again (and I may look for other styles from this manufacturer since I now know the fit will work ... )

So far I like the material it's made of. It doesn't ride up as easily as others do. I do wish I could have found this in a normal tshirt style as opposed to a muscle shirt. My only issue is that I wear between a XXL and XXXL depending on which brand shirt I buy, so I purchased a XXL compression shirt. Once I tried it on, it was too big so I exchanged it for a XL which is not quite as tight as I'd like but it will work. Overall, considering the price and quality, I will order more.

The product is coming from the UK, so it took a long time to arrive, and when it did, I found that the shirt was WAY TOO SMALL, especially in the arms.  Because of the international issues, it wasn't worth it to send it back for a full refund (the shipping I would have had to pay was about the same as the refund, so I took the partial). I brought the shirt to work today to have a co-worker try it on--she's thin and skinny and usually wears a S-M...and it fit her PERFECTLY...so there is NO WAY it was a 2XL.  Very disappointing.  I like the material and the style, and had it fit, it would have been a nice shirt for summer (lightweight and breezy).  The necklace included is super cheap but cute.

I ordered up because I didn't want it to be fitted. That was a good call because this dress tends to run small.  However, I am not sure why this dress retails for $58. It is thin (really thin) and light. The fabric (blend of polyester, spandex and rayon) feels great against the skin. Overall, the design of the dress is cute, but I don’t think it’s worth the retail price on Amazon.

Tiny crystals are embedded in the bezel which add just the right amount of bling but not too much.  And finally, this watch is affordable.

    Complete Text: I have this pair of leggings that have photos of Macrons on it- the bright beautiful colored little pastries that come in yellow, pink, aqua, green, yellow, etc. that look like a tiny whoopie pie with filling in it.  This shirt is the PERFECT companion to those.  Let's take a look at this shirt.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SHIRT LIKE?<br />First of all, when I got this shirt, I ordered it because it was advertised as almost all cotton with a little spandex in it.  I prefer cotton shirts.  When I received it, however, it was made of 82%rayon 11%nylon 7% elastane.  It just so happens that I can wear rayon and nylon.  If it had been polyester, I would have been more upset about the incorrect labeling.  The appearance is like a T-shirt with set in sleeves and light rouching on the bottom sides.  The color is a cotton candy pink- nice perfect pink color.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS SHIRT LOOK?<br />The shirt itself is cute.  The sleeves are short but not too long or too short- they hit at the top third of biceps.  The hem is straight not angled.  The arm holes are on the tight side for a large, but they are not too tight that I can not wear this.  I have larger upper arms and this shirt is not too tight at the hems like many are, so I am glad about that.<br /><br />The length is nice- I am about a size 14 and over 5'6" which is a bit tall for females and this fits well.  Sizing is about right for a 14.  If you are a 16, I am thinking this might be a bit snug for you.<br /><br />WASHING?<br />Rayon has a tendency to shrink, so I would like to mention that this is hand wash and air dry shirt only.  The instructions are symbolic, but I seem to feel that they agree with my assessment.  No other instructions are given for care.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a cute form fitting shirt, this is a nice choice to wear for relaxing.  Goes great with leggings or yoga pants.  Although it is for action wear, hand wash/air dry is important if you want to keep it from shrinkage.  Also it runs a bit small so order a size up if in doubt.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  I do like this shirt, the workmanship and fit, but instructions for care should be written more clearly at least on the tag for the US market.

Then the stitching started coming apart and fraying, like they used the cheapest, free thread that China could possibly produce. Had a friends daughter completely re-sew every seam (I really wanted to like and keep this jacket). Then on a long trip with it, the zipper pull broke itself. A sleeve adjuster (thin rubber with a snap) tore itself off (I actually found the torn-off end, but it's where it attaches, so there's no way to fix). Overall, the jacket is a fail. Looked good, but made so China-cheap that I have no doubt it would disintegrate if I ever hit pavement wearing it. Looking for something, ANYTHING, other than Tourmaster.

I liked that it was large, long and had pockets. Unfortunately it split down the seam in back of my arm within 20 minutes of wearing it in the rain and I had to throw it out. It looks like it is a manufacturer's malfunction. I make purchases from Amazon (long time Prime member) nearly every month and this is my first bad review.

I'm 5'7 and wear 0-2 in pants with athletic not-super-skinny legs. My reasons for returning - One leg seam has a section of extra stitching poking out and if I cut it, it will unravel the leg seam and leave a hole on the side. The elastic in the waistband is sewn in too tightly in some spots making it sit unevenly. The bottom of the legs aren't hemmed, and it looks like it was sloppily cut at home with scissors. The pants were very baggy on me even for a Small (and I tried them on with tights underneath), plus the high-waist is way too long for my torso. I do not recommend them.<br /><br />Fortunately, I bought two similarly styled pants on Amazon that I am happy with from the seller Daisy Del Sol (go look them up!).

    Complete Text: Fabric feels like cheap swimsuit material, but the overall appearance of the dress is pleasant which earns it 3 stars. I read reviews suggesting to size up, so I went with a Small. After trying it on, I found the best for me would be an Extra Small (you can see the armpit area is too large for me in my photo). So if you are Extra Small, especially in your top size, don't size up! The neckline is a little bit too low to wear to work without a camisole underneath. I would not suggest safety-pinning this fabric either (at least in the lighter patterns) because it will probably leave a noticeable hole. The overall pros: Great selection of patterns, nice wrap style. Overall cons: feels cheap like a swimsuit which constantly makes me feel self-conscious wearing it. For $39.99, I could have found a better quality dress at TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc. but will keep this one for casual outings and casual work days.

That made it too big for me because I am 5'3", 117 lbs with a 36DD chest and would typically wear a size small in this type of knitwear (US sizing).<br /><br />It's a boxy cut and not especially flattering except that the extra fabric in the pockets adds a little shape to the hip area. Despite the crisp laser cut holes, it was a nothing type of dress that looked kind of frumpy on me. I don't need any help in that department at my age.<br /><br />I can usually make anything work, but I am at a loss with this dress because  It's doesn't even work as loungewear.<br /><br />I cinched it in back to get an idea of what this dress might look like if it were closer to the right size and it didn't look too bad.<br /><br />However, I am not a fan of maxi dresses, and the split front panel felt a bit annoying as I walked.

I read the reviews here and was surprised at reviews and wondered if this isn't exactly the same. HOWEVER, it is the same style, cut, quality. And it was so much cheaper! It looks great on him and he's so very pleased with it. I just don't understand the negative reviews here... it's not heavy weight which is good when you live in North Carolina. Highly recommend!

    Complete Text: I purchased this item purely to take a photo of my daughter in it for St. Patrick's Day. The item arrived promptly, even though the shipping estimate put it arriving 5 weeks after it did.<br /><br />The quality of the outfit is great. It is soft and stretchy and the little leggings are warm and fit nicely. The headband let a little to be desired, but it fit. The only problem is that after one hand-wash (a very GENTLE hand wash at that!) the sequins began falling off the front of the shirt (a lot).<br /><br />The color of the items is different on each one. It's hard to tell once it's on a child, but the green is a different shade on the onesie, leggings, and headband.<br /><br />I hand-washed these items carefully before using on my daughter. They are hand wash cold only. I hung them to dry. The items were a bit larger than other 12M articles but that is to be expected as I chose the 12-18M size option. Room to grow!<br /><br />The clothing was soft, but I wouldn't keep my child in the onesie too long on a hot day, as it seemed to lack breathability and my daughter became sweaty. I am betting this is because of the stretchy material.<br /><br />I would buy this outfit again as it really IS adorable and is very soft. :) I've attached her St. Paddy's Day photos.

So on a normal-sized North American, South American, or European, they would be shorter. They have pockets, which is good, but they are shallow, so things will fall out when you sit. If you have animals, this textured fabric is pretty &#34;grabby&#34; for hair. If you hate shorts and don't want to or can't wear skirts, the airflow this style of pants allows on hot days is a really big deal for staying cooler in excessive heat. Even in this darker color, the difference was amazing. Color was true to the picture, and is a nice, deep color.

    Complete Text: I bought these going they'd offer me a little more modesty when I go to the gym, since i wear shorts and a tank top.  I ordered them in XXL, thinking they'd surely shrink once washed.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I opened the package.  These things are pretty tiny.  I am currently a size 10/12, and they fit me like a WOMAN'S XL would fit...which, I guess in men's sizes would equal to somewhere in between a medium and a large. And that's before washing!<br /><br />Also, the cut is really odd.  As a woman, I obviously have much thinner shoulder widths than most men. These actually seem to be cut too narrow in the neckline/armhole region.  In other words, if you have ever seen the back shoulder area of a &#34;racerback&#34; tank top, that's kinda how these are cut both in the front AND back.  So, since they are cut narrow there but then jut out and are cut straight in the stomach area, they look really frumpy.<br /><br />I know I'm a female buying a male's item, but this isn't my first time trying on unisex clothing, so...yeah. The fit is weird.  Given the narrow cut of the shoulder width and the small size of the items overall, I think these were definitely made in Asian sizes--which are often 3-4 sizes smaller than US size.<br /><br />The good:<br />The material is great.  Not at all flimsy or light, has a great &#34;hand&#34; to it (in other words, very soft...before washing, as i can't yet say how they'll feel once they shrink and the sizing is removed).  It's quality knit fabric--something I do actually know a bit about since I've been sewing apparel for thirty five years.

In comparison, this Slytherin ring is very disappointing.<br /><br />The crest design is too small for the width of the band. I have the ring on as I type this review, my hand on my laptop keyboard, and all I see is a gray smudge. I can’t make out the detail of the crest. If I spin the ring to center a better part of the design, then I see a gray and green smudge.<br /><br />In my opinion, cutting the house crests in half horizontally wasn’t a great design decision. If they wanted to use the crests, they should have gone with a wider band.

My mom normally wears an X-Large, but when she tried these on, in size X-Large, she could barely get them up. The leggings were incredibly unflattering on her, and she had them on all of five minutes before taking them off because she didn’t like the fit. Out of curiosity, I tried them on and the X-Large almost fit me -- and I wear a size medium.<br /><br />There’s nothing “sculpting” about these leggings. They are soft and stretchy, which is great -- they are comfortable if the size is right. But they don’t tuck you in anywhere.<br /><br />I like the flap top cargo pockets. They actually fit a big phone, I tried with my Note 20 Ultra to see if it would fit, and it does. So iPhones and other smaller phones definitely fit. The flap top pockets could also be used for money or wallets, whatever’s inside shouldn’t fall out and there aren’t any zippers to poke against your legs.<br /><br />The leggings are easy care: machine wash cold, tumble dry low or line dry. There is a bundle of six care tags on the back waist seam.

I put one on top of a similar style, size medium Nike sports bra. The Talanes sports bra is an inch smaller in the band and almost 2 inches smaller in the cup area.<br /><br />Naturally, I was worried the sports bras wouldn’t even fit, or would be so tight they would be uncomfortable. To my surprise, they do fit, because they are so stretchy and lightweight.<br /><br />But the bras are so stretchy and lightweight -- they offer virtually no support. I don’t need much, but I like compressive, supportive sports bras. I can’t wear these for any athletic activity, but they will work for lounging.<br /><br />Construction is okay. I’m not sure how well the mesh panel on the front will hold up; one of the sports bras had a few snagged areas when I got it.

It seems to be a guessing game.<br /><br />The measurements for the size large are: 21” wide (42” total), and 27” long. The hem at the waist narrows slightly. I washed and tumble dried this sweatshirt on low without any noticeable shrinking or pilling.<br /><br />This sweatshirt isn’t the most flattering to wear. I’ve tried a few Actloe sweatshirts so maybe it’s me, but I end up looking like a tubby panda in everything from this brand. The sweatshirt is also kind of noisy, with the black quilted area on the front making scratchy noises everytime I move. The polyester there is stiff; I know I’m wearing it, if that makes sense.<br /><br />The biggest plus is that the sweatshirts are warm, so they’re great for wearing in the house in the winter. It’s made in China from 100% polyester. The fur does shed on clothing even after washing, and also picks up lint/fuzz.

It is well worth the money at under twenty dollars, but judge for yourself by the video.<br /><br />It is a golden heart inside of a silver one, and the silvertone has a double row of crystals. Not the super sparkly kind, but crystals none the less. In my opinion, it is a little nicer than my video could capture.<br />Mixing metal tones is not only very trendy, but also allows you to choose whatever metal color you like for your other jewelry you wear that day. It will go with your gold hoops or your silver huggies.<br /><br />Threaded through is a petite box chain. The heart doesn't slip around easily, which is a huge plus. How many times have you worn a pendant only to look in the mirror and the clasp is no longer at the back of your neck?<br />This one stays put.<br />The clasp is easy, it's the lobster claw type. Sometimes they are hard to open, but this one unlocks smoothly, although if you have absolutely no fingernails you'll have to master using the side of your thumb or finger. The extender has a tiny little fob at the end, a nice little touch.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting it for someone else as a gift, it comes on a card that is in a clear bag, and then inside of a velvet drawstring pouch.<br />The velvet isn't that awful scratchy kind that screams 'Cheap Stuff Inside!'. It is soft, and printed with the company name (Mondaynoon Jewelry) in gold.<br />Shipping was a lot quicker than I expected. It was nicely padded in bubble wrap for protection from careless postal equipment.<br /><br />Is it Tiffany? No, of course not. But if you've ever been in the costume jewelry department at Penneys or even Macy's, they sell similar things.<br /><br />For Christmas, as a holiday stocking stuffer, a birthday, or for Valentine's Day, or just because someone likes hearts, this is a sweet little gift.

It fit true to size and feels supportive for light workouts like Pilates or yoga, but obviously since it doesn't have any cups or structure, it is not supportive enough for aerobics.<br /><br />I love the fashionable design of this, how it has basically a synthetic underlayer with the mesh over the top and how the mesh straps add a second layer of light support.<br /><br />What I don't love about this is the quality level. The elastic band is just that, straight up elastic with itchy threads holding it together, I don't know why this brand persists in putting its name all over everything as though it is Lululemon, and the mesh is a little bit less soft and luxurious than I would personally prefer. The whole thing just feels like it was designed by someone awesome in the US but then made in China without a whole lot of oversight as to the materials.<br /><br />Overall it comes together well and is a bra that I will be happy to use and wear, but given how cool the designs are, I would love it if they would pay little more attention to their material and construction quality.

    Complete Text: This is a very handsome, vintage-style watch that has cool Gilded Age/Edwardian vibe.  The color is made to look like that of polished brass but it is not. The watch feels much lighter than it looks and won't weigh you down if carrying on your person or in your pocket.<br /><br />A ring of Roman numerals are inscribed on the inner ring while the outer ring has a nice embellished floral design motif. The time is a little hard to read because the window is small (about the size of a dime) but you can pretty much figure it out by the way the hand points toward one of the Roman numerals. If you press down on the top knob, it opens and you can see it much better. It comes with a matching chain that has the same antique feel as the watch.<br /><br />The windup mechanism is pretty cool because you don't often see windups these days (no reliance on batteries!) and there is a bigger picture window on the back through which you can more clearly see the gears moving around.  Very cool.<br /><br />It's handsomely packaged in a brown box and the watch rests on a velvet cushion. Very classy and I always like how Mudder packages their products.<br /><br />Overall this is a very fun watch that is convincingly antique for not a lot of money.

The underarm area is fine (meaning the arm holes are not too large) and I pulled it on easily without unzipping the side zipper.  On the side zipper - it is a 'hidden' zipper with a metal head - so you can feel it under your arm.  This is very important: the material content!  96% cotton and 4% spandex - most of the spandex is in the top tank portion of the dress. This is important for cleaning and considering sizing.  Cotton will shrink some.  Sizing up is probably a good idea with this in consideration. The dress is surprisingly light weight - super light really.  I was expecting it to be heavier. The directions instruct: Gentle wash, DO NOT bleach DO NOT tumble dry and cool iron.  Meh.  Iron??  NOT my favorite thing to do and so if you are planning to travel with it.. plan on pressing it. Of course, a crisp, pressed cotton can look nice - but is a pain. On my hour glass plus body the dress hits me just barely below the knee, before washing, which is my personal fav.  I did attach a pick showing the capris I plan to wear with it because I hate my knees so much.  (Remember - the capris are mine and do not come with the dress).  The picture doesn't do me or the dress justice - the dress draped nicely no lumps or rolls as it was loose enough on me - the pooch seen is a pocket popping out - other areas that 'look' like rolls are just print and how I am standing. Honestly, no rolls from my body.  I am hoping once the dress is properly pressed - the pocket edges will stay where they are supposed to.  The skirt is slightly see through as well.  I am wondering if a fun little slip that poofs out a bit might be fun with this.  But a regular slip might be good if you're not doing capris like me.  I LOVE navy and white and this print is bright, clear and crisp - to me it screams spring/summer - just with the navy and white print.  The top tank is navy, and v necked.  The v does show cleavage on me - but not in an obscene way - in my opinion - sorry my cell hand is blocking that area.  I purchased a navy shrug to wear with it - for warmth - living in Oregon - even in the summer, at night, it can be cool - the navy shrug is not a perfect match in color but very close and I think it is complimentary.  Finally at the price of this dress, considering how few times I will probably wear it, it's a worthy purchase - not quite 5 stars for me (no ironing would have made that more appealing) but definitely a dress that will work for may different events - my nieces summer wedding... a tea... luncheon meeting.. I probably will not take it with me for travel as I never desire or have time to press things or send them out - just my personal choice!  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

When I first took this out of the wrapper, I wasn't sure it would fit my wrist. I wear the larger size bands when given an option. It does fit and has a few notches to spare. The first time I put one of the pieces onto my Versa, it came out right away. I tried two more times before it was securely in place. The same thing happened with the other piece. Now that they are both installed, they really seem secure. I've tugged at them multiple times with the intent of trying to get it to come out and it has stayed in place. The band is slimmer than some of the others that I have gotten. Overall, I like it.

    Complete Text: This is a cute bracelet. I ordered it for my teen daughter who is a big nature lover. It's styled like the Pandora bracelets. It took me quite a while to figure out how to open this bracelet. There is a bead labeled Pandora that opens up. It keeps the open end in place. The directions were emailed separately and there are instructions with photos on the item description. If you are not careful when opening that bead up, the beads may fall off of the chain rope bracelet. It is a nice size, but it didn't fit my wrists. I am a plus sized mom and my wrist measures at 7.5 inches. This bracelet fits up to 6.5 inches. It does fit my daughter though. Most of the beads make sense and go along with the nature theme. However, one of the beads is a money bag with a dollar sign which is a little odd to have with a frog, apple, snake, and leaf. The beads can come off, so I will probably take that one off and add something else. Overall, it is cute. Just make sure that you pay attention to the measurements.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.

It’s always risky ordering jewelry sight unseen, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The hashtag has little crystals on it. The BFF is sturdy and solid. It doesn’t bend or flex when pressure is applied.  The chain is mid-range, but perfect for a teen. It doesn’t look like it’s going to break easily at all.  This is definitely something that my daughter is proud to give as a gift.

    Complete Text: I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick, sturdy, snug but not too tight, and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks, which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.<br /><br />One caveat, however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased, they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.<br /><br />To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact, I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.

O my i must vehemently disagree! These earrings are very light & cause NO discomfort at all! I am exceedingly sensitive to heavy earrings. These earrings, surprisingly are comfortable enough to sleep in and are whisper soft. I have. No problem with a review that accurately reflects the cons of a piece. However, none of the complaints listed herein accurately reflect the problems of these earrings. I have tried to completely & fairly represent these earrings. They are very inexpensive , but you get a lot of bang for your buck! I DO wish Amazon would give us some choices! At least 10k maybe 14k since gold prices have dropped so significantly!

    Complete Text: I am done with Zista jewelry. The description does not quite match what is received. The pendant is ok. Pretty-ish, but not as pretty and of quality looking that it should. I do have another Zista pendant and that is very pretty, but just like with this listing the chain is nowhere close to what it looks like in the picture. 1 star rating for both.<br /><br />I normally expect a basic cheap chain. If everything looked as it should and lined up with what is shown and described in the product description- then I would highlight that and consider it in my rating. But it doesn't.Usually a pendant is purchased for that part alone, and the chain is a token add on. But with this, I chose it based on the look of the chain and the look of the pendant as per the description. I am not pleased with either.<br /><br />The chain is a block "gold"- a weird color at that. One tone. The chain is very short. Barely 16". I cant even clasp it around my neck. If you have a super petite frame, then maybe it will work for you. Either way, this is a very short chain. The other one I have by Zista just barely closes, and is like a tight choker. SO this is even shorter. Sad.<br /><br />The pendant is petite, and barely pretty. It doesn't look as pretty as it does in the picture. None of it is looking as it should. Disappointed.

I love the style and she did, too, which is why it’s super disappointing that they caused such bad blisters (you’d think I’d learn the first time). We have gone through a lot of shoes so it’s not as if I don’t know what I’m doing. I see kids with vans and everything seems fine, but those are with the Canvas-only material, I think.

    Complete Text: My daughter is in love with this. It is the cutest bathrobe ever, but we were a little confused at first because it came just folded up as a bathrobe and in the picture it showed it also turning into a plush toy. Turns out there is a secret zipper inside that lets you turn it inside-out and fold the robe into itself, which then zips closed to reveal Doctor Unicorn, an adorably soft plush toy. This wasn't obvious but once you know what to look for, it isn't hard to do. My daughter didn't know it did that, she just loved the robe for being a robe. Once she saw it turned into a Unicorn toy,, she immediately fell head over heals for this and started dancing around the house with it.<br />I'll be honest, I wouldn't turn it into a plush toy while wet for fear of it getting moldy, but as long as the robe is clean and dry, we're totally going to keep it with her pillows and stuffed animals around her bed. Totally love this product, can't give it enough stars!

I have tried getting new ones from Amazon before, and I always found them to be of poor craftsmanship and VERY small. I'm usually a size L or XL, but judging from my experiences recently I decided to try an XXL of this one.<br />Well, the XXL just barely fits. Which is insane. Extra EXTRA large should be generous on me. It technically fits, but it is just tight enough that the buttons from my shirt underneath are suddenly very visible. I'm very disappointed. I wanted so badly to like this, but if 2 sizes too big doesn't fit, I can't say this product is worth much.

If you are giving this pendant as a gift, you won't even need to wrap it, the box looks that good.<br /><br />For those who believe in the metaphysical, this pendant comes with extras, as a quick google search shows:  "Obsidian is truth-enhancing. A strongly protective stone, it forms a shield against negativity. It blocks psychic attack and absorbs negative energies from the environment. Obsidian draws out mental stress and tension." Given the world we live in these days, I suspect many of us could use such a protective stone.  :)

I like mine to fit loosely. So, when I ordered this Goranbon shirt in an XL, I should have ordered up. It seems to be more of a fitted style. The style of fabric is waffle, but you can see through (thin) the material. So I would suggest wearing a tank or something underneath. And finally, what I do like is that the color is white and can be worn with anything - a skirt, shorts, jeans or khakis. So out of 5 stars, I would give it 3.

This dress was very “ill-fitting” on me. I looked pregnant even after adjusting the straps! Ironically, I ordered up because I feared that the top would be too tight, especially considering the style. The dress is tri-colored (cream, army green and eggplant) and sleeveless. The material is thin and plain. To be honest, I looked awful. It was so bad that I didn’t want to keep it to even wear around the house or to be.

I thought it would be a nice token gift for my husband. I like that it is neutral (unisex) and anyone can use it. It is black leather and chrome. The only difference that I will note, between the two keyrings, is that unlike the valet one, you can’t really remove the keys as easily. However, this keyring comes with three individual rings, that you can attach to the larger ring. This is perfect if you don’t carry a lot of keys, or if your car key is not bulky. **Note, some of the new cars have those big fobs which might not fit. However, because these keychains are so inexpensive (under $10), they make the  perfect gifts. For example, brides and grooms can purchase these for the bridal/bachelor party.  They would be perfect stocking stuffers, or gifts for co-workers. I’d highly recommend the Mehr brand and their products.

The XL seems to be around what I would think itd be but the construction of this top seems a bit off.<br /><br />The elastic on the top and bottom of the bandeau was tight and fitted but the fabric in-between seemed much looser. That would imply that there isn't as much compression through the whole top and that this bandeau is likely to give muffin top or squish in I think.

The photos don't do it justice. It's a heavy piece, but not too heavy. It has the right weight to it for something with that many stones in it. If it was lighter, I would have worried about the quality - but this is not the case. For the price, this is perfect - probably even better than I expected! The stones have a lot of sparkle to them, but it's hard to get that in a photo. This is a striking piece.The necklace has varied shades of blue, so it could go with many different blue clothing pieces, or go well with something contrasting. The metal has an antique brass look to it. It looks like something you'd find in a higher end boutique.  I have no doubt this will be a great statement piece for everyday or for a special event look. I'm very glad I took a chance and bought this one. This was an awesome find! I can't say enough good things about it! If you purchase, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Fun Daisy also packed this very securely in a cute box and bubble wrap inside. It arrived, no damage, in perfect condition.

    Complete Text: I was looking for something else when I saw this bracelet online. It’s described to be a ‘Turkish’ Evil Eye however it’s more of a Greek thing - these ‘evil eyes’ keep a person protected from harm and are usually worn at all times. I have 2 good friends that are Greek and they both have bracelets, necklaces, and other types of jewelry and decorative items for the house. I can’t comment on this bracelet, only what it’s used for.

    Complete Text: This is an exceptional bag.. Soft light with many pockets.. I ordered as a travel bag because the Olivia and Joy bag with the two Zippered pouches in the front was out of stock in black. This bag is marketed for baby but will also make a great travel bag.. The extra handles will attach to a cart or shopping rolling bag.. I will have this bag for many years and will purchase more Olivia and Joy items.. I just wish they would make the insides a different color from the outside..

Th light at night is barely visible and it's numbers are small but visible under the sun while being very light that you hardly feel it on your wrist. This wrist watch is also what President Barack Obama was wearing while he was in the White House for 8 years. It's timeless design and the simplicity you just can't beat. A Highly recommended wrist watch.

    Complete Text: I have purchased a few pieces from Netaya and have "tolerated" the merely so-so quality...until now. If there'd been a rating of NO stars, that would be the one I'd have choosen.<br /><br />This bracelet's online photo and description is deceiving. It is a hollow piece with no safety latch -- depending, instead, on just a spring-loaded hinge to hold the bracelet on your wrist, although the loss of it would be no hardship!<br /><br />It looks, feels and has the weight of plastic and I have re-gifted it to my cousin's ten-year-old daughter.<br /><br />By the way? NEVER purchase from this merchant outside the protection of Amazon's shopping cart. This is a pricey lesson I've learned the FIRST time and I will NOT be using this merchant again, nor can I, in all conscience, recommend them.

    Complete Text: These little strips really came in handy for my family this weekend and I think parts of the rest of this week.<br /><br />I live in the Portland Oregon area and we are experirncing a terrible "Super Massive" Smoke Event.  Since we don't have respirators we used this strips with resusable cloth masks and insertable filters to get our mail, meet the grocery delivery person and take out garbage out.<br /><br />The strips are easy to use and I think they really helped keep some of the toxic smoke out of our mouths and noses.<br /><br />My one complaint is that they are not very wide and because of the thickness of our resusable cloth face masks there isn't very much leeway when you line them up along the edges of your mask and onto your skin.<br /><br />Something else you should be aware of is to not use this on skin that has been recently moisturized.  My skin is super duper dry so the stickers were solid on my face but my husbands nose was kinda greasy since he had taken a shower a few hours previous and I think if it hadn't turned cool and he'd begun to perspire the sticker would have popped right off like a ball on a water slide.<br /><br />So about skin irritation; I didn't have any and I wore this for almost 40 minutes.  I have such dry skin that I use Eucerin on my face and it didn't even leave any marks, so it is super gentle.<br /><br />I tried using these with my glasses and they didn't fog up but I had to double some of the stickers to stop my breath from escaping the mask.<br /><br />Cost - Obviously buying a fitted mask would be more cost effective if you have to wear a mask to work or for anything more than an hour here and there.  But these are pretty great for the interim.

    Complete Text: This shirt is exactly as pictured.  The Tiger is just as colorful and ferocious as we'd hoped.  The material of this shirt is super duper thin, and not super stretchy, that wasn't what I was expecting.  But the shirt fits my husband and it fits over his man belly well enough to keep his belly button covered, that is a priority for him.<br /><br />I washed the shirt in cold water on the delicate cycle inside of a lingerie bag.  This shirt is an important part of my husband's Kraven the Hunter costume, so I didn't want to take any chances while laundering the shirt, hence the cold water and lingerie bag.  Also, I didn't put it through the dryer, I just slid it onto a hanger and let it air dry.<br /><br />The colors and the shape of the shirt stayed exactly the same!  It is surprisingly sturdy for such a thin material.

    Complete Text: Skinny women or teenagers will find the 18-inch chain more comfortable. For me, being a plus sized woman, the chain was not quite long enough and felt more like a choker. This would however make a nice gift for the right woman. The pendant is sparkly and pretty. The heart shape is nice for Valentine's day or Mother's day. I'm talking off one star because the chain is so short. Otherwise it is really a high quality item.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free necklace for review purposes.

    Complete Text: I worked construction, both industrial and residential for years. I never wore my dress ring due to it always clanking on something as I worked, not to mention it getting snagged and even shocked. Once, I tried to take a finger off with my metal ring. So, I had looked for a company for a long time selling soft rings and eventually just gave up. One weekend while the wife and I were hiking I decided once again to find a quality company/product.<br /><br />I found it in Qalo rings. We purchased ours from a local store. I was actually very surprised too find it available locally. The wife and I choose a set of rings and mine was 1 size smaller than I probably should have gotten.  I was a 1/2 size and worried about stretching etc, so I rounded down. Bad choice. Her's a perfect fit.<br />Due to the tightness of the ring I experience the itchy sensation and redness that others have experienced. I can say with 100% certainty, that its due to a smaller size ring. We ordered directly from Qalo last year and bought a second set. This time I went with the consensus and picked up the next full size. I have had no redness itching. I hardly remember I have it on now.<br />Do yourself a favor and choose the next larger size if your between sizes. I have never noticed any stretching and I am completely happy with the ring. We are ordering a new set within the next month. So as you can tell I/we are repeat customers. Well worth every penny I spent on the rings.

So it's going back, the color is awful on me. Quality is good. I am 5'3&#34; and it touches the floor. I might order another color. The fabric is flowy and princessy, lace is not itchy. Overall a nice dress.

It's especially challenging to avoid touching your eyes when you have long bangs and I have found this to be a good solution that offers adequate protection. and clarity  The ventilation helps prevent fogging. They are not the most comfortable thing to have to wear, but neither are masks and both have become essential to protect my health and wellbeing given the present circumstances.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

    Complete Text: The BAGAIL Clear Purse is great if you work in retail stores where they require you to use a transparent purse as well as stadiums and concerts, but for me, it serves a more practical purpose because I can be disinfected it with alcohol after going out in public or to the office. not something I want to do with my more expensive leather purse. it's large enough to hold all my essentials along with spare masks, a few pairs of gloves, and a bottle of hand sanitizer. When I am locking up my office at night I can use the flashlight on my phone while keeping it safely tucked inside this protective purse. The best part is that I don't have to use as much isopropyl alcohol on my devices at a time when it is in such limited supply. It is well made and offers excellent protection.

    Complete Text: I was impressed with the WiliW Women's Control Top Pantyhose because they are sheer and feel very silky, I'm way past due on a mani-pedi and thought I would surely snag them as I hurriedly tried them on. It's been a long time since I tried on pantyhose, and they survived with minimal damage and no runs. I am 5'3", 119 lbs, and typically wear a size small in bottoms. The size medium was a perfect fit, so they do run small. You'll want to size up if you are average height or carry a bit more weight. The control top was okay, but will not perform the miracles of good shapewear. I am not aware of any pantyhose that can. I consider this three-pack to be an excellent value, especially for this quality. I highly recommend these!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **

I have reviewed many inexpensive acrylic scarves and they have all been well made so my expectations were probably too high in light of what I just received.  The edges are poorly finished and rough with uneven threads. It looks very cheap, and I cannot recommend this.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.
